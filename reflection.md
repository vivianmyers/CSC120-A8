Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class represents a Wizard. My class creates a wizard with a certain amount of magic. The class allows the Wizard to learn spells, cast spells, pick up and drop items, undo certain spells, and move around.

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I added a magic() method that prints the amount fo magic a wizard currently has.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Worked: Look at all methods in the interface (including params and return type!!) and make a plan for ech method before writing

Didn't work: Not understanding each methods call signature completely before writing my class. This led to problems later when I realized that my class implementation made no sense.

Advice: Dont be afraid to spend more time planning and thinking about the assingment than you do actually coding!
